# Installation Guide

Hey there, fellow coder! 🚀 Ready to get started with Aura UI? Good news—no big downloads needed! Let’s keep it simple.

## Copy, Paste, and Ship! 🚢

Honestly, if you just want to try out some simple components, you might not need to install anything. Just:

1. Find a component you like in Aura UI.
2. Copy the code.
3. Paste it into your project.
4. Customize as needed and ship it! 🏆


## Tailwind CSS

Aura UI loves Tailwind CSS. If you don’t have it yet, let’s get you set up:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS:**
   ```bash copy
   npm install -D tailwindcss
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind:**
   Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file:
   ```javascript copy
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind to your CSS:**
   In your CSS file, add the following:
   ```css copy
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
